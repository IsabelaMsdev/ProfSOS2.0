# 🚀 Quick Start Guide for Colleague

## 📋 **What You Need to Test**

The original developer cannot connect to MongoDB due to corporate firewall. We need you to test if the connection works from your network.

## ⚡ **Super Quick Test (2 minutes)**

1. **Clone/Download the project**
2. **Navigate to backend folder:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the automated test:**
   ```bash
   node mongoDbTests/run-tests.js
   ```

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### ✅ **If Connection Works:**
```
✅ PASSED - Simple Connection Test
✅ PASSED - Environment Test
🎉 CONNECTION WORKING!
```

### ❌ **If Corporate Firewall Blocks:**
```
❌ FAILED - Simple Connection Test
❌ FAILED - Environment Test
🚨 CONNECTION ISSUE DETECTED
```

## 🔧 **Manual Tests (if needed)**

If the automated test doesn't work, try individual tests:

```bash
# Basic connection test
node mongoDbTests/simple-test.js

# Environment-based test
node mongoDbTests/test-connection.js

# Diagnostic test
node mongoDbTests/diagnose-connection.js
```

## 🌐 **Test from Different Networks**

If tests fail, try from:
- ✅ Home network
- ✅ Mobile hotspot
- ✅ Different office network

## 📝 **What to Report Back**

Please send back:

1. **Test Results:**
   - ✅/❌ Connection tests passed/failed
   - Which network you used

2. **If Tests Pass:**
   - Start server: `node server.js`
   - Test health: `curl http://localhost:5000/health`
   - Run user tests: `node mongoDbTests/test-users.js`

3. **If Tests Fail:**
   - Error messages you see
   - Network type (corporate/home/mobile)

## 🎯 **The Goal**

We just need to confirm:
- ✅ MongoDB connection works from non-corporate networks
- ✅ The application starts and runs correctly
- ✅ User registration and ticket system work

## 💡 **Why This Matters**

The SoS-prof system is a complete ticket management platform for educational institutions. It allows:
- Professors/academics to submit support tickets
- Tech support to manage and resolve tickets
- Smart assignment of tickets to appropriate technicians

Once we confirm the connection works, the system is ready for deployment!
